REM1: There is a missing ups_data.js scripts required in Makefile.am, but this file doesn't exist.

REM2: During ./autogen.sh, nut and nut-dll are cloned locally, it takes lot of time. Can't we get ride of this?
=> Note that the second time (if needed) you launch autogen script, it goes much more faster

REM3: At the end of configuration, I have this listing:
> Configuration summary:
> ======================
> build serial drivers: yes
> build USB drivers: yes
> build SNMP drivers: yes
> build neon based XML driver: yes
> enable Avahi support: no
> build Powerman PDU client driver: no
> build IPMI driver: no
> build Mac OS X meta-driver: no
> build i2c based drivers: no
> enable SSL support: yes (OpenSSL)
> enable libwrap (tcp-wrappers) support: yes
> enable libltdl (Libtool dlopen abstraction) support: yes
> build nut-scanner: yes
> build CGI programs: no
> build and install documentation: no
> build and install the development files: no
=> Why build and install documentation and development files are not available?

REM4: When it comes to test website, the make process is definetely too long and should not be needed,
=> Can't we just stubbed it so that we use 'fake' content during tests?

./autogen.sh
After clone:
Second use: 28 seconds

./configure
After clone:
Second use: 45 seconds

REM5:
=> Could we put all Javascript links at the end of document so that pages load faster
